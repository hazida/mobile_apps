# Lab Exercise 1: Designing a University Examination System Mobile App Using Stitch (Google)

## 1. Lab Overview

In this lab exercise, students will use **Stitch (Google)**, an AI-powered UI design tool, to design a **mobile application interface** for a **University Examination System**. The system is designed for **Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)** students to view examination-related information such as results, examination timetable, and academic status.

This lab focuses on **UI/UX design**, **system understanding**, and **prompt engineering**, not programming.

## 2. Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lab, students will be able to:

1. Explain the purpose of a university examination system.
2. Design mobile app UI screens using AI-based tools.
3. Write clear and structured design prompts.
4. Evaluate and refine AI-generated UI designs.
5. Produce a professional academic mobile app prototype.

## 3. Tools and Requirements

### Software / Tools

* Web browser (Chrome recommended)
* Google Account
* Stitch (Google): [https://stitch.withgoogle.com/](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/)
* Figma (optional, for export and refinement)

### Knowledge Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of:

  * University academic systems
  * Mobile application interfaces
  * UI elements (buttons, cards, menus)

## 4. System Background: University Examination System

The **University Examination System** allows students to:

* Log in using university credentials
* View examination timetable
* View examination results
* Check academic status (Pass / Fail / Dean’s List)
* Read official examination announcements

The mobile app must follow a **formal, professional, and academic design style** suitable for a public university.

## 5. Lab Tasks

### Task 1: Access Stitch (Google)

1. Open a web browser.
2. Go to **[https://stitch.withgoogle.com/](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/)**
3. Sign in using your Google account.
4. Ensure you can see the **design prompt input interface**.

### Task 2: Define the App Requirements

Before generating the design, clearly understand the app requirements.

#### Application Details

* Application Type: Mobile App
* Target Users: University Students
* Institution: Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)
* System: Examination System

#### Required Screens

1. Login Screen
2. Student Dashboard
3. Examination Timetable
4. Examination Results
5. Academic Status
6. Examination Announcements

### Task 3: Write the Design Prompt

In the Stitch prompt box, enter the following **complete and structured prompt**.

```
Design a modern mobile application for a University Examination System.
The application is for Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) students.

Include the following screens:
1. Login screen with university-style design
2. Student dashboard showing student name, matric number, faculty, and semester
3. Examination timetable screen with course code, date, time, and venue
4. Examination results screen showing course code, grade, and GPA
5. Academic status screen showing pass/fail status and academic standing
6. Examination announcements screen for official notices

Use a clean, professional, and formal design.
Apply a blue and white color theme suitable for a public university.
Ensure clear navigation and readable text.
```

### Task 4: Generate the Design

1. Click the **Generate** button.
2. Wait for Stitch to generate the UI design.
3. Observe the generated screens and navigation flow.

### Task 5: Review the Generated UI Design

Evaluate the design based on the following aspects:

* Are all required screens present?
* Is the layout suitable for an academic system?
* Is the color scheme professional?
* Is the navigation logical and simple?
* Are the labels clear and formal?

Take notes on any weaknesses or missing elements.


### Task 6: Refine the Design Using Follow-Up Prompts

If improvements are needed, use a refinement prompt.

#### Example Refinement Prompt

```
Improve the examination results screen by making it more structured and formal.
Add clear section headings and improve readability.
```

Repeat this step until the design meets academic expectations.

### Task 7: Export the Design (Optional but Recommended)

1. Export the design to **Figma**.
2. Open the design in Figma.
3. Make minor improvements if needed, such as:

   * Adding UTM logo
   * Renaming labels to official academic terms
   * Improving spacing and alignment



## 6. Student Deliverables

Students must submit the following:

1. Screenshots of all generated app screens
2. The final design prompt used
3. A short written explanation (300–500 words) covering:

   * Purpose of the Examination System
   * Explanation of each screen
   * Design choices (colors, layout, navigation)



## 7. Lab Reflection Questions

Students should answer the following:

1. How does AI help speed up UI design?
2. What are the limitations of AI-generated designs?
3. Why is a formal UI important for university systems?
4. How would this design be improved for real implementation?


## 8. Conclusion

This lab demonstrates how AI tools such as Stitch can support **early-stage system design** in academic environments. Students gain experience in **design thinking**, **prompt engineering**, and **UI evaluation**, which are essential skills in modern software development.
