## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Setup Dependencies

```powershell
cd "c:\Mobile Apps Development\MAP-DevX\engineering_store"
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Configure Firebase (One-time)

```powershell
# Install FlutterFire CLI if not already installed
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

# Configure Firebase for Android
flutterfire configure --platforms=android --project <YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID>
```

This command generates:
- `lib/firebase_options.dart` - Firebase configuration
- `android/app/google-services.json` - Android Firebase setup

### 3. Launch Emulator

```powershell
# List available emulators
flutter emulators

### Firestore Security Rules

Ensure your Firestore security rules allow:
- Authenticated users to read/write their own data
- Admins to manage all collections
- Real-time synchronization for all collections

Example (development):
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /inventory/{document=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid != null;
    }
    match /receivings/{document=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /issuance/{document=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /movement_logs/{document=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth.uid == userId || request.auth.uid != null;
      allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Data Synchronization
- **Inventory List** uses Firestore `StreamBuilder` for real-time updates
- **Usage History** combines data from `receivings` and `issuance` collections using `Rx.combineLatest2`
- **Movement Logs** shows all movements from `movement_logs` collection
- Requires active Firebase connection for real-time sync

### Transaction Recording
- When you receive an item, it updates: `receivings`, `movement_logs`, and `inventory` collections
- When you issue an item, it updates: `issuance`, `movement_logs`, and `inventory` collections
- Stock is automatically adjusted on both operations

### Android Emulator
- reCAPTCHA is disabled for development testing on emulator
- Use release builds for production deployment

### Firestore Collections
- Collections are created automatically on first write operation
- Ensure proper security rules are set for all collections

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### App won't run
```powershell
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Firebase connection issues
- Verify Firebase project ID in `android/app/google-services.json`
- Check Firestore security rules allow your user access
- Ensure internet connection on emulator

### Items not appearing in inventory list
- Check Firestore has `inventory` collection with documents
- Verify Firestore security rules allow read access
- Check Flutter console logs for errors (run with `flutter logs`)

### Transactions not appearing in usage history
- Verify `receivings` and `issuance` collections have documents
- Check that timestamp field is saved correctly (should be Firestore Timestamp type)
- Verify rxdart dependency is included in pubspec.yaml
- Check Firestore security rules allow read access to both collections

### Version conflicts
- Review `pubspec.yaml` for Firebase package versions
- Run `flutter pub upgrade` to update compatible versions
