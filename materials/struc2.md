* A method named `displayMember()` that prints the member’s details

(10 marks)

c. Differentiate between `final` and `const` in Dart, and explain when each should be used in application development.
(5 marks)



## **Question 2: Flutter Widgets & Layout (20 marks)**

You are required to design a simple **profile screen** for a mobile application.

a. Explain the difference between **StatelessWidget** and **StatefulWidget**, including one suitable use case for each.
(6 marks)

b. Draw a **widget tree diagram** for a profile screen that contains:

a. Define **Dependency Injection** and explain its importance in building scalable Flutter applications.
(5 marks)

b. Describe how **Constructor Dependency Injection** can be used to supply a weather service to a widget. State one advantage and one limitation of this approach.
(5 marks)
