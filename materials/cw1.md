The proposal must include:

* Project background and problem statement
* Project objectives and scope
* Target users and identified user needs
* Overview of proposed application features
* Project timeline or development milestones

### 2.2 Logbook (GitHub-based) (12 Marks)

Students must maintain a project logbook to document the development progress throughout the semester.

The logbook must:

* Be maintained using the group’s **GitHub project repository**
* Contain regular progress updates (weekly or milestone-based)
* Describe tasks completed by each team member
* Include screenshots or images of development activities
* Record issues or challenges encountered and the actions taken to resolve them
