# **MCQ: Dependency Injection (DI)**

### **Question 1**

What is a **dependency** in software development?

A. A variable that stores user input

B. A piece of code that relies on another code component

C. A widget used to manage layouts

D. A function that does not return a value



### **Question 2**

What is the main goal of **Dependency Injection (DI)**?

A. To reduce the number of widgets in an application

B. To supply required dependencies to a class or widget

C. To eliminate the use of constructors

D. To improve UI rendering speed



### **Question 3**

Which of the following best describes **Global Dependency Injection**?

A. Dependencies are passed through constructors

B. Dependencies are created inside each widget

C. Dependencies are accessible globally throughout the application

D. Dependencies are limited to a single screen



### **Question 4**

What is a major **disadvantage** of Global Dependency Injection?

A. It requires too many constructors

B. It can lead to tight coupling and difficulty in testing

C. It cannot be used with widgets

D. It increases application size



### **Question 5**

Which Dependency Injection approach passes dependencies through a class or widget constructor?

A. Global DI

B. InheritedWidget DI

C. Constructor DI

D. Service Locator DI



### **Question 6**

Why is **Constructor Dependency Injection** not suitable for deep widget trees?

A. Constructors cannot accept parameters

B. Dependencies must be forwarded through many widget levels

C. It does not support asynchronous operations

D. It only works with StatelessWidgets



### **Question 7**

Which Dependency Injection approach uses the `of(context)` method?

A. Global DI

B. Constructor DI

C. InheritedWidget DI

D. Service Locator DI



### **Question 8**

Which of the following is a common example of **InheritedWidget Dependency Injection** in Flutter?

A. `Navigator.of(context)`

B. `setState()`

C. `runApp()`

D. `build()`



### **Question 9**

What is the main benefit of using **InheritedWidget DI**?

A. It eliminates the need for state management

B. It avoids passing dependencies through constructors

C. It creates global variables automatically

D. It improves animation performance



### **Question 10**

What is a **Service Locator** in the context of Dependency Injection?

A. A widget that locates services visually

B. A central registry that provides dependencies on request

C. A database connection manager

D. A layout optimization tool



### **Question 11**

Which package is commonly used as a **Service Locator** in Flutter?

A. `provider`

B. `http`

C. `get_it`

D. `flutter_bloc`



### **Question 12**

Which statement about **Service Locator DI** is TRUE?

A. Dependencies are always newly created

B. It removes the need for dependency registration

C. Dependencies are retrieved from a central registry

D. It only works with StatefulWidgets



### **Question 13**

Which registration type in a Service Locator returns the **same instance every time**?

A. Factory

B. Singleton

C. Prototype

D. Temporary



### **Question 14**

Which registration type creates the dependency **only when it is first requested**?

A. Factory

B. Singleton

C. LazySingleton

D. Scoped



### **Question 15**

Which statement best describes the relationship between **Dependency Injection and application architecture**?

A. DI replaces the need for architecture patterns

B. DI tightly couples components together

C. DI supports modular, maintainable, and testable code

D. DI is only useful for small applications
