## 🧩 Flutter Emulator Options for Windows and macOS

When teaching or developing with **Flutter**, it’s important to have a reliable emulator to test and run your applications. Below are the recommended emulators for both **Windows** and **macOS** platforms.

### 💻 For Windows

1. **Android Emulator (via Android Studio)**

   * The most common and official option for Flutter development.
   * Supports various Android versions and device configurations.
   * Can simulate phones, tablets, and even Wear OS devices.

2. **Windows Desktop Emulator**

   * Flutter supports building and running native Windows apps.
   * You can directly run and test Flutter apps in a Windows environment without a mobile emulator.

3. **Visual Studio Android Emulator (optional)**

   * A lightweight alternative for testing Android apps on Windows.
   * Requires installation of Visual Studio with the Mobile Development workload.

### 🍎 For macOS

1. **Android Emulator (via Android Studio)**

   * Same as Windows — works seamlessly for testing Android apps.
   * Allows multiple device configurations.

2. **iOS Simulator (via Xcode)**

   * Exclusive to macOS.
   * Required for testing and debugging iOS applications.
   * Provides access to various iPhone and iPad models.

3. **macOS Desktop Runner**

   * You can run Flutter apps directly on macOS as desktop applications.
   * Ideal for testing UI responsiveness and native integration.
